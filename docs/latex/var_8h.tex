\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \doxylink{classVar}{Var} class. 

It is the header file for the \doxylink{classVar}{Var} class, which stores information about properties of an object, keeps track of what each \doxylink{classVar}{Var} is dependent on, and writes it to files. Full information on each \doxylink{classVar}{Var} is stored in vars\+\_\+raw, which is read and written for cannonical vars. A tree describing all the dependencies is in vars\+\_\+tree, managed by the tree functions.
