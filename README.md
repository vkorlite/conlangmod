ConLangMod is a project that helps conlangers systematize their conlangs, and write complex, i.e. not just simple character replacements, rules for changes in languages. More indepth explanations for the proposed workings of ConLangMod are in outlide.md

The project currently is in its early stages, only barebones stuff, only a database connection and basic data types coded. Currently trying to set up the rule system (vcb).
