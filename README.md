ConLangMod is a project that helps conlangers systematize their conlangs, and write complex, i.e. not just simple character replacements, rules for changes in languages. It takes an object oriented approach to language.

The project currently is in its early stages, only barebones stuff, only a database connection and basic data types coded. Currently trying to set up the rule system (vcb).
